# Instaling-Solver
Setup collects login info and device specific button location
Login information is stored locally in a .txt file
Instaling-Solver.py uses words.csv for storing and retrieving known words. The program learns them automatically as it encounters them. 
If you ever need to reset the dictionary(words.csv) remember to leave the first row intact.
The program was built with polish-german in mind so the Ids in html of your version may be slightly different. You can adjust them directly in the Instaling-Solver.py file.
The program can be used and modified for personal only.
